    """Timestep Dropout.

    This version performs the same function as Dropout, however it drops
    entire timesteps (e.g., words embeddings in NLP tasks) instead of individual elements (features).

    # Arguments
        rate: float between 0 and 1. Fraction of the timesteps to drop.

    # Input shape
        3D tensor with shape:
        `(samples, timesteps, channels)`

    # Output shape
        Same as input
